Samsung photo frame control with download ability for Raspberry Zero
=================

Slightly modified version of [Gekkio/samsung-photo-frame-ctrl](https://github.com/Gekkio/samsung-photo-frame-ctrl)
The intended use is to use Raspberry Pi Zero W in combination with Samsung photo frame to show photos downloaded from the Internet.

The main differences are:
* Added support for second version (firmware 10.08) of SPF-107H.
* Implemented logging
* Added downloading with Curl (Pycurl)
* Added reading from a local folder
* Added PIL for manipulating with pictures
* Added config.py for additional settings
* Added simple gallery with download or local folder option
* Added support for Neopixel Led strip as background ambient light
* Implemented CLI

Features
--------
* The behavior can be configured via config.py
  
* frame_ctrl.py
  * If the photo frame is in mass storage mode, the program will change it into mini display mode.
  * If the photo frame is in mini display mode, the program will send the jpeg that was specified as the program argument to the photo frame. *The JPEG must be prescaled to the exactly correct size!*
    
* show-image.py
  * Resize and center the image specified as the program argument and call frame_ctrl to show the image
  * Can show text over the image
 
* slideshow.py
  * In mode IMG_SOURCE = 1 (FOLDER) shows images from folder defined in IMG_SOURCE_PATH in random order
  * In mode IMG_SOURCE = 2 (URL) downloads images from URL defined in IMG_SOURCE_PATH

* txt2img.py 
  * Converts text to image. Output can be piped to show-image.py
